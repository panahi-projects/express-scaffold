# Welcome to Express Scaffold

Are you tired of setting up the same boilerplate code for every new Express.js project? Look no further! Our handy batch script, express-scaffold.bat, takes care of all the initial setup for you, so you can focus on building your app instead of preparing the basics.

### What does it do?

When you run express-scaffold.bat, it creates a new directory with all the necessary files and configurations for a standard Express.js project. This includes:

    - A `package.json` file with the latest versions of Express.js and Mongoose
    - A `src` directory with a basic folder structure for your app
    - A `config` directory with sample configuration files for Express.js and Mongoose
    - A `public` directory with a basic index.html file
    - A `routers` directory with a sample route for handling HTTP requests
    - A `models` directory with a sample schema for a MongoDB database using Mongoose
    - A `controllers` directory with a sample controller for handling API requests
    - A `app.js` file that ties everything together and starts the server

But wait, there's more! express-scaffold.bat also includes support for Mongoose, the popular Object Data Modeling tool for Node.js. With just one command, you'll have everything you need to get started with MongoDB databases in your Express.js project.

### How to use it?

Using express-scaffold.bat couldn't be easier. Simply navigate to the directory where you want to create your new project, and run the following command:

`.\express-scaffold.bat`

That's it! Your new project will be created in a matter of seconds, ready for you to start developing.

### Configuration options

By default, express-scaffold.bat creates a new project with the name "My App". You can customize the project name by passing a flag to the command:

`express-scaffold.bat --name MyProject`

This will create a new project called "MyProject" instead of "My App".

You can also choose to exclude certain features from the generated project by passing additional flags:

express-scaffold.bat --no-mongoose --no-routes
This will create a new project without the Mongoose integration and routes.
